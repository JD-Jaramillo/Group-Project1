# Recipe and Restaurant Suggester
As a user I want to search for recipes using an ingredient or cuisine, when I search then I want to get recipe results in order to get a set of instructions for preparing a particular dish including a list of ingredients required. When I select a cocktail from the dropdown I also want to get a list of cocktails with images and ingredients.
